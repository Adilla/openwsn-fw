This folder contains only "standalone" projects. These consists of a single source file, and are not connected in any way to bsp, drivers, OS or stack. The point of these projects is to show the simplest possible code to test an atomic feature of the board.

They show you exactly what register you need to play with to fulfill some function, but, agreed, are pretty much useless beyond that.
